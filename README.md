# KickstartR
Predicting success on Kickstarter

Notes:

1. The data is split across zip files to fit within the file size limitations of Github. The R script and Rmd will reunite them, provided they are in the working directory at the time.

2. The pdf has been compressed using the Adobe service at https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html in order to bring it below the Github file size limitation.

3. Some of the models may take a long time to train even when using reduced size training data sets. For this reason, they are marked to not be evaluated by Knitr in the Rmd file.
